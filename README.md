# The_Odin_Project
This is the repo where I will upload all my TOP projects

The "Test" folder will be where all the projects or scripts I use for testing are located.

Then there is the "Odin Excercises" folder. In this folder is where The Odin Project's downloadable excercises will be located. 

Finally we have "Odin Projects". Inside this folder is where the projects of The Odin Project will be located. An example of a project is a landing page or
a calculator.
